# Kristoffer Szilas alternative personal webpage
## It is an alternative webpage

He does not use alternative webpage for his blog updates, but he let me do an alternative one.

Visit his page is on  https://www.kristofferszilas.com/ .
### **_Introduction_**
I chosed Kristoffer original page as a reference because of:
 1. I am also originally a geologist
 2. his blog posts and pictures are amazing.

 ### **_Project itself_** 
 The aim of the project was to dig deep in to Bootstrap 5 and use minimum CSS and JS. Same time to make the page webaccessible.
 ### **_Used Technologies_**
 1. HTML

**Aim of the Project**

First and main goal was to get to know Bootstrap 5 deeply. Using as many features as possible.
Secondly I wanted to focus on web accessibility, namely aria- features. I also added an extra icon which make the font size bigger and the pictures gray-filtered. 

**Challenges within the Project**

1. Own JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 are not freinds sometimes. It sounds funny, but making the gray filter through the webpage was actually challenging because of Bootstrap 5 built-in JS. In the end the problem was solved (by using gray filter just on images).

## **_What have I learned_**
Bootstrap 5.

## Deployed: 2022. March.
